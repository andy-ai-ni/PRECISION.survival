Description: The package builds survival prediction model using miRNA expression data with batch effect correction using either BatMan or ComBat along with optional
	data normalization methods. It evaluates the prediction accuracy of the model by calculating the concordance index (C-index) on a test dataset. The package 
	also provides a function to simulate training and test datasets from the paired MSKCC miRNA expression datasets.
